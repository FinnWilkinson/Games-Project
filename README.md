# Games-Project

This unit was undertaken over the whole of my 3rd year at the University of Bristol. 

For this unit, we were assigned into teams of between 5 and 7, and had to create an interactive and engaging game using Unity coupled with hardware such as VR head sets, Microsoft Kinects, IR technology just to name a few.
For my groups game, we used a HTC Vive and planned to create a horror game set in a hospital setting. 

Whilst good progress was made, due to the COVID-19 outbreak the unit was turned into a formative assessment, with the only requirements being that we submitted the game in its current state along with a report describing our process up to this point. SKills such as team work and management were achieved, along with programming proficiency, however the game itself is in an unfinished state.
